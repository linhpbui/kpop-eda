# K-Pop in numbers: Exploring K-Pop beyond its stunning and extravagant visuals 
## Overview
This project explores the K-pop industry by analyzing and visualizing public available data to answer these following questions:
- How many entertainment companies are there?
- How many groups are there, divided down by type (boy, girl, co-ed)?
- Which group type is more stable in terms of member consistency and activity?
- What is the median age of idols when they debuted?
- Aside from South Korean, what other nationality debuted in the industry?

Visit [this page](https://nbviewer.org/github/linhpbui/kpop-eda/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) to see the codes and interactive graphs.

## Methodology
This Exploratory Data Analysis project is done on Python. The datasets were taken from [dbkpop](https://dbkpop.com/).

## Highlighted results
- The number of female to male idols are almost the same, albeit there are more incentive for boy bands then there are for girl bands. 
- On top of the sexualization and exploitation practices behind the scene, debuting minors is a heated topic among the K-pop fans. 
- More female idols debuted at much younger ages than male idols, and very few female idols debuted after the age of 23. 
- As K-pop expands, companies have more idols who aren't South Koreans to appeal to the international market, particularly from Japan and China.

I wrote a blog on the results, which can be read [here](https://linhpbui.com/side-work/kpop/).
